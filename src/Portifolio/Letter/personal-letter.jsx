                <h3>Dear Recruiter,</h3>
                <br></br><br></br>
        
                <p>
                My name is Marco Castellani, and I would like to introduce my professional journey and qualifications for opportunities in the software development field.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                I began my career working with custom furniture, a profession that has been in my family since my grandfather, who still works with wood furniture. Motivated to broaden my knowledge, I started learning how to create 3D projects to better interpret and execute the necessary designs. This interest led me to create projects for the commercial sector, where I developed the ability to create accurate visual representations.
                </p>

                <p>
                As I delved deeper into this field, I moved to a company where I could work directly on the execution of projects. I developed my own workflow, focusing on efficiency and error minimization, which resulted in many successful projects. With this experience, I was invited to develop modules for the company's library in the Promob system, my first encounter with coding and structural logic.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                Being self-taught, I learned to work with the Promob system independently, identifying and solving technical challenges. This ability led to me being hired by several companies to develop their libraries and integrate ERP systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                Currently, I work with a plugin in the SketchUp graphical engine, applying my knowledge in carpentry and developing 3D projects. Throughout my career, I have studied various 3D programs, including Maya 3D, ZBrush, Blender, SketchUp, and Promob.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                With the goal of expanding my skills, I began studying systems programming, initially focusing on low-level languages such as Java and C. However, I recognized the growing demand for FullStack developers and redirected my studies to JavaScript, falling in love with React and Nest.js. I am currently developing a React application, as well as an API, striving to create an application as close to real as possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                Although I do not have a specific path defined for my programming career, I enjoy challenges and learning new things. I believe that every challenge can add value to my career, and I am confident in my ability to find effective solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                I am eager to contribute my skills and learn even more in a challenging and innovative environment. Thank you for the opportunity to present my profile, and I am available for an interview.
                </p>
                    <br></br><br></br>
                <p>
                Sincerely,<br></br>
